## About

This is a development build and should be considered as “work in progress”. The content changes on a daily basis. This is not an official product release yet.

## Purpose

Medication Overview (ravimiskeem) is part of practitioner's new software (TJT) where he/she can easily get an accurate and up-to-date overview of patient's medication. Practitioner can add or remove medications and issue prescriptions. Currently patient may have several duplicating prescriptions and it is difficult for a healthcare proffessional to have a proper overview of patient's medication. 

### In scope:

-	MedicationStatement
-	MedicationRequest
-	MedicationDispensation
-   ClinicalUseDefinition

### Out of scope:

-	MedicationAdministration (will be part of hospital medication IG in near future)
-	Coverage – reinbursement of patient’s medication is arranged from Estonian Health Insurance Fund side and not relevant in practitioner’s software view.

## Background

First phase of development is tightly connected with Estonian Medical Prescription Center so Medication Overview is a copy of legacy prescribing system gradually moving towards new generation health data exchange.

## TJT

TJT – Tervisejuhtimise töölaud - is a new software currently under developement for healthcare proffessionals. TJT is going to be developed module by module Medication Overview being the first module. TJT is a central tool aiming to bring health care proffessionald in common space in order to add, display and exchange health data with each other.
